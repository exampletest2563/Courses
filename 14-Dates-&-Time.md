---

**Example 1: Creating TimeSpan Instances**

```csharp
TimeSpan duration1 = new TimeSpan(1, 12, 30, 0); // 1 day, 12 hours, 30 minutes
TimeSpan duration2 = TimeSpan.FromHours(24);     // 24 hours
TimeSpan duration3 = TimeSpan.Parse("2.05:30:00"); // 2 days, 5 hours, 30 minutes
```

In this example, we create TimeSpan instances representing different durations of time using various constructors and factory methods. We specify durations in days, hours, minutes, and seconds, demonstrating different ways to create TimeSpan objects.

---

**Example 2: Performing Arithmetic Operations with TimeSpan**

```csharp
TimeSpan duration1 = new TimeSpan(1, 12, 30, 0); // 1 day, 12 hours, 30 minutes
TimeSpan duration2 = new TimeSpan(0, 8, 45, 0);  // 8 hours, 45 minutes

TimeSpan totalDuration = duration1 + duration2; // Addition
TimeSpan difference = duration1 - duration2;    // Subtraction
TimeSpan multipliedDuration = duration1 * 2;    // Multiplication
TimeSpan dividedDuration = duration1 / 2;       // Division
```

In this example, we perform arithmetic operations with TimeSpan objects, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. These operations allow us to combine, compare, and scale TimeSpan values, demonstrating the flexibility of working with TimeSpan structures.

// Using the default culture (current culture)
Console.WriteLine(date.ToString("D")); // Output: Saturday, March 19, 2022
Console.WriteLine(date.ToString("D", CultureInfo.GetCultureInfo("fr-FR"))); // Output: samedi 19 mars 2022

// Using custom date and time format strings
Console.WriteLine(date.ToString("dd/MM/yyyy")); // Output: 19/03/2022
Console.WriteLine(date.ToString("yyyy-MM-dd")); // Output: 2022-03-19
```

In this example, we format the current date and time using the default culture (current culture) and the French (France) culture. We also demonstrate custom date and time format strings for displaying dates in different formats.

---

**Example 2: Parsing Dates and Times with CultureInfo**

```csharp
string dateStr = "10/03/2022";

// Using the default culture (current culture)
DateTime parsedDate = DateTime.Parse(dateStr);
Console.WriteLine(parsedDate.ToString("D")); // Output: Thursday, March 10, 2022

// Using specific culture for parsing
parsedDate = DateTime.Parse(dateStr, CultureInfo.GetCultureInfo("fr-FR"));
Console.WriteLine(parsedDate.ToString("D")); // Output: jeudi 10 mars 2022
```

In this example, we parse a date string using the default culture (current culture) and the French (France) culture. This demonstrates how CultureInfo can be used to parse date strings according to specific culture settings.

DateTime tomorrow = now.AddDays(1); // Create a new DateTime object representing tomorrow

Console.WriteLine("Current date and time: " + now);
Console.WriteLine("Date and time tomorrow: " + tomorrow);
```

In this example, we use the immutable DateTime structure to represent the current date and time in UTC and calculate the date and time for tomorrow. By using immutable DateTime objects, we ensure that the original DateTime object remains unchanged, promoting safer and more predictable code.

---

**Example 2: Handling Time Zones Effectively**

```csharp
DateTime localTime = DateTime.Now; // Get local system time
TimeZoneInfo timeZone = TimeZoneInfo.FindSystemTimeZoneById("Eastern Standard Time"); // Define target time zone
DateTime easternTime = TimeZoneInfo.ConvertTime(localTime, timeZone); // Convert local time to Eastern Time

Console.WriteLine("Local time: " + localTime);
Console.WriteLine("Eastern time: " + easternTime);
```

In this example, we demonstrate how to handle time zones effectively by converting a DateTime object from the local time zone to the Eastern Time zone. By using the TimeZoneInfo class, we can perform accurate time zone conversions and ensure that our date and time calculations are correct across different time zones.

[NodaTime](https://nodatime.org/) is a powerful date and time library for .NET that provides a more comprehensive and flexible API compared to the built-in DateTime and TimeSpan structures. It offers support for various calendar systems, time zones, and date-time arithmetic operations. Let's see how we can use NodaTime to work with dates and times in C#.

```csharp
using NodaTime;

LocalDateTime localDateTime = new LocalDateTime(2022, 3, 15, 10, 30);
DateTimeZone timeZone = DateTimeZoneProviders.Tzdb["America/New_York"];
ZonedDateTime zonedDateTime = localDateTime.InZoneStrictly(timeZone);

Console.WriteLine("UTC Offset: " + zonedDateTime.Offset); // Output: UTC Offset: -04
Console.WriteLine("Local Date and Time: " + zonedDateTime.LocalDateTime); // Output: Local Date and Time: 2022-03-15T10:30:00
```

In this example, we create a LocalDateTime object representing a specific date and time in a specific time zone using NodaTime. We then convert it to a ZonedDateTime object to work with time zone information.

**Chapter 2: Implementing Date and Time Features in Real-World Applications**

In this chapter, we'll explore practical examples of implementing date and time features in real-world C# applications. We'll discuss common scenarios such as event scheduling, recurring tasks, and deadline management, and demonstrate how to implement them using advanced date and time handling techniques.

**2.1 Event Scheduling Application**

```csharp
using NodaTime;

public class Event
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public LocalDateTime StartTime { get; set; }
    public Duration Duration { get; set; }

    public LocalDateTime EndTime => StartTime + Duration;
}

public class EventScheduler
{
    public void ScheduleEvent(Event e)
    {
        // Logic to schedule event
        Console.WriteLine($"Scheduled event '{e.Name}' from {e.StartTime} to {e.EndTime}");
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Event event1 = new Event
        {
            Name = "Meeting",
            StartTime = new LocalDateTime(2022, 3, 15, 14, 0),
            Duration = Duration.FromHours(1)
        };

        EventScheduler scheduler = new EventScheduler();
        scheduler.ScheduleEvent(event1);
    }
}
```

In this example, we define a simple Event class to represent events with a name, start time, and duration. We then create an EventScheduler class to schedule events. This demonstrates how to use advanced date and time handling techniques to implement real-world features such as event scheduling in C# applications.
