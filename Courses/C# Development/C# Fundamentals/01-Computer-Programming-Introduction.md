# 🎓 Computer Programming Introduction

## 🌍 Data, Information & Knowledge

Data refers to a collection of raw facts, often presented in numerical or symbolic form. Data could refer to anything that could be measured, counted or qualified.

In C#, data is often represented using variables. Variables act as containers for storing different types of data, such as numbers and symbols.

Information is data that has meaning, context, and purpose. Information is what we derive when data is collected, analyzed and presented in a meaningful way, order or context.

In C#, this involves processing and organizing data through algorithms and logic.

Knowledge represents the wisdom we gain when we understand and connect different pieces of information. Knowledge is the deeper understanding or the application of information in a meaningful way that comes from putting together various bits of data and information and making sense of them.

## 💾 Data Storage

Computers use two main storage components:
- `RAM` (Random Access Memory);
- `HDD` (Hard Disk Drive) or `SSD` (Solid State Drive).

Both components are physical components used for data storage. The main difference between `RAM` and `HDD` is the type of storage.

`HDD` stores data permanently. It is responsible for storing all data no matter if the machine is turned on or off.

`RAM` stores data temporarily. It is responsible for all applications that run on the computer.

## 💻 Computer Programming & Programming Languages

Computer programming is the art of instructing computers to perform specific tasks. It's a creative process where we communicate with machines using a set of instructions.

Programming languages act as the bridge (interface) between human thought and machine execution. They represent sets of rules and symbols used to write instructions (code) that computers can understand and execute.

Programming paradigms define the style of programming. C# supports imperative, declarative and object-oriented paradigms.
