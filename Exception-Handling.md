# ðŸ§¨ Exception Handling

## ðŸš« Invalid Input

It is crucial to handle invalid input gracefully to prevent crashes and create user-friendly applications.

Different exceptions can occur based on the nature of invalid input. For example, `FormatException` is thrown when converting a string to a numeric type, and `OverflowException` can occur if the value is too large.

```csharp
Console.Write("Enter a number: ");
string userInput = Console.ReadLine();

if (int.TryParse(userInput, out int result))
{
	Console.WriteLine("You entered: {0}.", result);
}
else
{
	Console.WriteLine("Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.");
}
```

## Guides

Invalid input can come from various sources: typos, incorrect data types, or unexpected user behavior. Your program needs to be able to handle these scenarios without breaking. Always validate user input to ensure it meets your program's expectations.

Make error messages user-friendly! Instead of showing generic messages, provide context-specific feedback to guide users on how to correct their input.

// TODO: Invalid input! Please, enter a valid number.
// TODO: Something went wrong!

// TODO: Interface

**Chapter 1: Understanding Exceptions**

Welcome to the chapter on exceptions in C#! In this chapter, we'll explore the concept of exceptions, which are unexpected or exceptional events that occur during the execution of a program. We'll discuss why exceptions are important, how they are handled in C#, and best practices for dealing with them.

**1.1 What are Exceptions?**

Exceptions are unexpected or exceptional conditions that arise during the execution of a program and disrupt the normal flow of control. These conditions can include errors such as divide by zero, invalid input, file not found, or network failure. When an exception occurs, the program may terminate abruptly unless it is properly handled.

**1.2 Why are Exceptions Important?**

Exceptions are important because they provide a mechanism for handling error conditions and recovering from unexpected situations in a controlled manner. By catching and handling exceptions, you can gracefully handle errors, prevent program crashes, and ensure the reliability and robustness of your software.

**Chapter 2: Handling Exceptions in C#**

In this chapter, we'll learn how to handle exceptions in C# using try-catch blocks. We'll explore the syntax for catching exceptions, rethrowing exceptions, and handling specific types of exceptions.

**2.1 Handling Exceptions with try-catch Blocks**

```csharp
try
{
    // Code that may throw an exception
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    // Handle the exception
    Console.WriteLine("An error occurred: " + ex.Message);
}
```

In this example, we use a try-catch block to catch any exception that occurs within the try block. If an exception occurs, control is transferred to the catch block where we can handle the exception by displaying an error message.

**2.2 Rethrowing Exceptions**

```csharp
try
{
    // Code that may throw an exception
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    // Log the exception
    LogError(ex);

    // Rethrow the exception
    throw;
}
```

In this example, we catch an exception, log it using a custom method `LogError`, and then rethrow the exception using the `throw` keyword. Rethrowing exceptions allows higher-level code to handle the exception or terminate the program if necessary.

**2.3 Handling Specific Types of Exceptions**

```csharp
try
{
    // Code that may throw an IOException
}
catch (IOException ex)
{
    // Handle IOException
    Console.WriteLine("An IO error occurred: " + ex.Message);
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    // Handle other types of exceptions
    Console.WriteLine("An error occurred: " + ex.Message);
}
```

In this example, we catch specific types of exceptions using multiple catch blocks. This allows us to handle different types of exceptions differently, providing more granular error handling.

---

In this chapter, we've explored the basics of exceptions in C#, including what they are, why they're important, and how to handle them using try-catch blocks. Understanding how to handle exceptions is essential for writing reliable and robust C# applications.

**Chapter 1: Introduction to Exception Handling**

Welcome to the chapter on handling exceptions in C#! In this chapter, we'll explore the importance of exception handling in software development and learn how to effectively handle exceptions in C# applications.

**1.1 Understanding Exceptions**

Exceptions are unexpected or exceptional events that occur during the execution of a program and disrupt the normal flow of execution. Examples of exceptions include division by zero, null reference exceptions, and file not found exceptions. Exception handling is the process of responding to and managing these unexpected events to prevent program crashes and ensure graceful degradation.

**1.2 Importance of Exception Handling**

Exception handling is crucial for writing robust and reliable software. By properly handling exceptions, you can prevent unexpected crashes, improve the stability of your applications, and provide better user experiences. Effective exception handling also helps in debugging and troubleshooting issues, as it provides valuable information about the cause of errors.

---

**Chapter 2: try-catch Blocks**

In this chapter, we'll dive into the basics of exception handling in C# using try-catch blocks.

**2.1 Syntax of try-catch Blocks**

```csharp
try
{
    // Code that may throw an exception
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    // Handle the exception
}
```

In a try-catch block, you enclose the code that may throw an exception within the try block. If an exception occurs during the execution of the try block, control is transferred to the catch block, where you can handle the exception.

**2.2 Handling Specific Exceptions**

```csharp
try
{
    int result = 10 / 0; // This will throw a DivideByZeroException
}
catch (DivideByZeroException ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Error: Division by zero.");
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine("An unexpected error occurred: " + ex.Message);
}
```

In this example, we catch a specific DivideByZeroException and handle it separately from other types of exceptions. Catching specific exceptions allows for more targeted error handling and provides better control over the exception flow.

---

**Chapter 3: finally Block and Resource Cleanup**

In this chapter, we'll explore the finally block and its role in resource cleanup and exception handling.

**3.1 Using the finally Block**

```csharp
FileStream fileStream = null;
try
{
    fileStream = new FileStream("example.txt", FileMode.Open);
    // Code that uses the file stream
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine("An error occurred: " + ex.Message);
}
finally
{
    fileStream?.Dispose(); // Cleanup code executed regardless of whether an exception occurred
}
```

The finally block is used to execute cleanup code that should always run, regardless of whether an exception occurred in the try block. This is useful for releasing resources and performing cleanup operations to ensure proper program termination.

---

In this chapter, we've covered the basics of exception handling in C#, including try-catch blocks, handling specific exceptions, and using the finally block for resource cleanup. Effective exception handling is essential for writing robust and reliable software, and mastering these techniques will help you build more resilient applications.

#### 3. Throwing Exceptions
   - 3.1 Using throw Statement
   - 3.2 Throwing Specific Exception Types
   - 3.3 Creating Custom Exception Types

**Title: C# Fundamentals: Throwing Exceptions**

---

**Chapter 1: Introduction to Throwing Exceptions**

In this chapter, we'll explore the concept of throwing exceptions in C#. Exceptions are a mechanism for handling errors and exceptional situations in software. We'll discuss why and when exceptions should be thrown, as well as best practices for handling exceptions in your C# code.

**1.1 Understanding Exceptions**

Exceptions represent abnormal conditions or errors that occur during the execution of a program. When an exception is thrown, the normal flow of execution is interrupted, and the runtime searches for an exception handler to handle the exception. If no handler is found, the program terminates with an unhandled exception error.

**1.2 Why Throw Exceptions?**

Exceptions are thrown to indicate that something unexpected or erroneous has happened in the program. This could be due to invalid input, unexpected system behavior, or other exceptional conditions. By throwing exceptions, you can signal to the calling code that an error has occurred and provide information about the nature of the error.

**1.3 Best Practices for Throwing Exceptions**

When throwing exceptions in C#, it's essential to follow certain best practices to ensure clarity and maintainability of your code. Some best practices include:
- Throwing meaningful and descriptive exceptions that accurately reflect the nature of the error.
- Providing additional context or information in the exception message to aid in debugging and troubleshooting.
- Avoiding unnecessary or overly broad exception handling, as this can obscure the root cause of errors.

---

**Chapter 2: Throwing Built-in Exceptions**

In this chapter, we'll explore how to throw built-in exceptions provided by the .NET framework. C# provides a wide range of pre-defined exception types for common error scenarios, making it easy to signal different types of errors in your code.

**2.1 Throwing ArgumentNullException**

```csharp
public class Calculator
{
    public int Divide(int dividend, int divisor)
    {
        if (divisor == 0)
        {
            throw new ArgumentNullException(nameof(divisor), "Divisor cannot be zero.");
        }
        return dividend / divisor;
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Calculator calculator = new Calculator();
        try
        {
            int result = calculator.Divide(10, 0);
            Console.WriteLine("Result: " + result);
        }
        catch (ArgumentNullException ex)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Error: " + ex.Message);
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the Divide method of the Calculator class throws an ArgumentNullException when the divisor is zero. We catch the exception in the Main method and handle it appropriately by displaying an error message.

**2.2 Throwing InvalidOperationException**

```csharp
public class BankAccount
{
    private decimal balance;

    public void Withdraw(decimal amount)
    {
        if (amount > balance)
        {
            throw new InvalidOperationException("Insufficient funds.");
        }
        balance -= amount;
    }
}
```

In this example, the Withdraw method of the BankAccount class throws an InvalidOperationException when attempting to withdraw more funds than are available in the account.

#### 4. Exception Propagation
   - 4.1 Understanding Exception Propagation
   - 4.2 Unhandled Exceptions and Program Termination
   - 4.3 Propagating Exceptions Across Method Calls
   - 4.4 Propagating Exceptions Across Threads

**Title: C# Fundamentals: Exception Propagation**

---

**Chapter 1: Understanding Exception Propagation**

Exception propagation refers to the process of passing exceptions from one part of a program to another. In C#, when an exception occurs within a method and is not handled locally, it propagates up the call stack until it is caught or until it reaches the top-level entry point of the application. In this chapter, we'll explore how exceptions propagate in C# and the mechanisms for handling them.

**1.1 How Exceptions Propagate**

Exceptions propagate up the call stack in C# until they are caught by an appropriate catch block or until they reach the top-level entry point of the application. Each method in the call stack has the opportunity to catch and handle the exception or propagate it further.

**1.2 Handling Exceptions**

```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        try
        {
            DivideByZero(); // Exception occurs here
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Exception caught: " + ex.Message);
        }
    }

    static void DivideByZero()
    {
        int result = 10 / 0; // Division by zero exception
    }
}
```

In this example, the `DivideByZero` method throws a `DivideByZeroException` when attempting to divide by zero. Since the exception is not caught locally within the method, it propagates up the call stack to the `Main` method, where it is caught and handled.

---

**Chapter 2: Exception Handling Strategies**

In this chapter, we'll explore different strategies for handling exceptions in C#, including using try-catch blocks, throwing exceptions, and rethrowing exceptions.

**2.1 Using try-catch Blocks**

```csharp
try
{
    // Code that may throw an exception
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    // Handle the exception
}
```

**2.2 Throwing Exceptions**

```csharp
throw new Exception("An error occurred");
```

**2.3 Rethrowing Exceptions**

```csharp
catch (Exception ex)
{
    // Log the exception
    throw; // Rethrow the exception
}
```

---

**Chapter 3: Propagating Custom Exceptions**

In this chapter, we'll explore how to propagate custom exceptions in C# and how to create and throw custom exceptions.

**3.1 Creating Custom Exceptions**

```csharp
public class CustomException : Exception
{
    public CustomException(string message) : base(message)
    {
    }
}
```

**3.2 Throwing Custom Exceptions**

```csharp
throw new CustomException("Custom exception message");
```

---

In this chapter, we've explored exception propagation in C#, different exception handling strategies, and how to propagate custom exceptions. Understanding exception propagation is essential for writing robust and reliable C# applications.

**Chapter 1: Introduction to Exception Handling**

Welcome to the chapter on exception handling best practices in C#! Exception handling is a crucial aspect of software development, allowing you to gracefully handle runtime errors and unexpected conditions. In this chapter, we'll explore best practices for effectively managing exceptions in your C# applications.

**1.1 Understanding the Importance of Exception Handling**

Exception handling plays a vital role in ensuring the reliability and robustness of software systems. By properly handling exceptions, you can prevent unexpected crashes, provide meaningful error messages to users, and facilitate debugging and troubleshooting processes.

**1.2 Overview of Exception Handling in C#**

In C#, exceptions are objects that represent errors or unexpected conditions that occur during program execution. Exceptions are thrown when an error occurs, and they can be caught and handled using try-catch blocks or propagated up the call stack to be handled by higher-level code.

---

**Chapter 2: Best Practices for Exception Handling**

In this chapter, we'll discuss best practices for effectively handling exceptions in C# applications. These practices will help you write robust and reliable code that gracefully handles errors and maintains the stability of your software.

**2.1 Use Specific Exception Types**

```csharp
try
{
    // Code that may throw FileNotFoundException
    using (StreamReader sr = new StreamReader("file.txt"))
    {
        // Read file contents
    }
}
catch (FileNotFoundException ex)
{
    // Handle FileNotFoundException
    Console.WriteLine($"File not found: {ex.FileName}");
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    // Handle other exceptions
    Console.WriteLine($"An error occurred: {ex.Message}");
}
```

When catching exceptions, it's essential to be as specific as possible about the types of exceptions you expect. Catching broad exceptions like `Exception` can make it challenging to diagnose and handle specific errors.

**2.2 Log Exceptions**

```csharp
try
{
    // Code that may throw an exception
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    // Log exception
    Logger.LogException(ex);

    // Rethrow exception
    throw;
}
```

Logging exceptions is crucial for debugging and monitoring purposes. It provides valuable information about the cause of errors and helps developers diagnose and fix issues more effectively. Additionally, logging exceptions can aid in identifying patterns of errors and improving the overall reliability of the software.

**2.3 Clean Up Resources with Finally Blocks**

```csharp
FileStream fs = null;
try
{
    fs = new FileStream("file.txt", FileMode.Open);
    // Code to read from the file
}
catch (IOException ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"An IO error occurred: {ex.Message}");
}
finally
{
    // Close the file stream
    fs?.Close();
}
```

Finally blocks are used to clean up resources regardless of whether an exception occurs. This ensures that resources are properly released and prevents resource leaks in your application.

---

In this chapter, we've explored some best practices for handling exceptions in C# applications, including using specific exception types, logging exceptions, and cleaning up resources with finally blocks. By following these practices, you can write more robust and reliable code that gracefully handles errors and maintains the stability of your software.

#### 6. Exception Filters (C# 6.0 and later)
   - 6.1 Introduction to Exception Filters
   - 6.2 Syntax of Exception Filters
   - 6.3 Using When Clause for Exception Filtering
   - 6.4 Handling Specific Conditions with Exception Filters

**Title: C# Fundamentals: Exception Filters (C# 6.0 and later)**

---

**Chapter 1: Introduction to Exception Filters**

In this chapter, we'll delve into the concept of exception filters in C#. Exception filters provide a more granular and flexible way to handle exceptions by allowing developers to specify conditions under which an exception handler should be executed. We'll explore how exception filters work, their syntax, and their advantages over traditional catch blocks.

**1.1 Understanding Exception Filters**

Exception filters enable developers to specify conditions that determine whether an exception handler should be invoked. Unlike traditional catch blocks, which execute unconditionally when an exception occurs, exception filters provide more control over exception handling by allowing developers to specify when an exception handler should be triggered based on specific conditions.

**1.2 Syntax of Exception Filters**

The syntax for exception filters was introduced in C# 6.0 and consists of the `when` keyword followed by a boolean expression enclosed in parentheses. When an exception is thrown, the runtime evaluates the exception filter's boolean expression, and if it evaluates to true, the corresponding exception handler is executed.

```csharp
try
{
    // Code that may throw an exception
}
catch (Exception ex) when (ex is InvalidOperationException)
{
    // Exception handler with a filter
    Console.WriteLine("Invalid operation exception occurred.");
}
```

In this example, the exception filter `(ex is InvalidOperationException)` specifies that the corresponding exception handler should only execute if the caught exception is of type `InvalidOperationException`.

---

**Chapter 2: Benefits of Exception Filters**

In this chapter, we'll explore the advantages of using exception filters in C# code. Exception filters offer several benefits, including improved code readability, reduced duplication, and better separation of concerns. We'll discuss these benefits in detail and illustrate them with examples.

**2.1 Improved Code Readability**

Exception filters enhance code readability by allowing developers to express exception handling logic directly in the catch block, rather than cluttering the try block with additional conditional logic. This makes it easier to understand the intent of the exception handling code and improves code maintainability.

```csharp
try
{
    // Code that may throw an exception
}
catch (Exception ex) when (ex is ArgumentException)
{
    // Exception handler with a filter
    Console.WriteLine("Argument exception occurred.");
}
catch (Exception ex) when (ex is InvalidOperationException)
{
    // Another exception handler with a filter
    Console.WriteLine("Invalid operation exception occurred.");
}
```

In this example, each catch block contains a concise and focused exception filter, making it clear which exceptions are handled by each handler.

**2.2 Reduced Duplication**

By using exception filters, developers can avoid duplicating exception handling logic across multiple catch blocks. Instead of repeating the same conditional checks in each catch block, developers can define a single exception filter that applies to multiple catch blocks, reducing redundancy and improving code maintainability.

```csharp
try
{
    // Code that may throw an exception
}
catch (Exception ex) when (ex is ArgumentException || ex is InvalidOperationException)
{
    // Exception handler with a filter for multiple exceptions
    Console.WriteLine("Argument or invalid operation exception occurred.");
}
```

In this example, the exception filter `(ex is ArgumentException || ex is InvalidOperationException)` handles both `ArgumentException` and `InvalidOperationException` with a single catch block, eliminating the need for separate catch blocks for each exception type.

---

In this chapter, we've explored the concept of exception filters in C#, their syntax, and their benefits over traditional catch blocks. Exception filters provide developers with more control and flexibility in handling exceptions, leading to clearer and more maintainable code.

#### 7. Exception Handling Patterns and Anti-patterns
   - 7.1 Common Exception Handling Patterns
   - 7.2 Anti-patterns in Exception Handling
   - 7.3 Refactoring and Improving Exception Handling Code
   - 7.4 Best Practices for Exception Handling Design

**Title: C# Fundamentals: Exception Handling Patterns and Anti-patterns**

---

**Chapter 1: Introduction to Exception Handling**

Welcome to the chapter on exception handling patterns and anti-patterns in C#! Exception handling is a critical aspect of software development, as it allows developers to gracefully handle unexpected errors and maintain the stability and reliability of their applications. In this chapter, we'll explore common exception handling patterns and anti-patterns in C#, along with best practices for effectively managing exceptions.

**1.1 Understanding Exceptions in C#**

Exceptions represent unexpected or exceptional conditions that occur during the execution of a program, such as invalid input, file not found, or network errors. In C#, exceptions are represented by objects of types derived from the System.Exception class. By catching and handling exceptions, developers can prevent application crashes and provide meaningful error messages to users.

**1.2 Importance of Exception Handling Patterns**

Exception handling patterns define strategies and techniques for effectively managing exceptions in software applications. By following established patterns, developers can ensure that exceptions are handled consistently and appropriately across their codebase. However, it's essential to be aware of anti-patternsâ€”common pitfalls and mistakes that can lead to poor exception handling practices and code quality issues.

---

**Chapter 2: Exception Handling Patterns**

In this chapter, we'll explore some of the most commonly used exception handling patterns in C#. These patterns provide guidelines and best practices for handling exceptions in a structured and maintainable manner.

**2.1 Try-Catch-Finally Pattern**

```csharp
try
{
    // Code that may throw exceptions
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    // Handle the exception
}
finally
{
    // Code that runs regardless of whether an exception occurred
}
```

The try-catch-finally pattern is the most basic exception handling pattern in C#. It allows developers to try a block of code that may throw exceptions and handle any exceptions that occur in the catch block. The finally block is used for cleanup code that should run regardless of whether an exception occurred.

**2.2 Rethrow Pattern**

```csharp
try
{
    // Code that may throw exceptions
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    // Log the exception
    LogException(ex);

    // Rethrow the exception
    throw;
}
```

The rethrow pattern is used when you want to catch an exception, perform some logging or cleanup operations, and then rethrow the exception to propagate it up the call stack. This pattern allows you to centralize exception logging or handling logic without losing information about the original exception.

**2.3 Custom Exception Pattern**

```csharp
public class CustomException : Exception
{
    public CustomException(string message) : base(message)
    {
    }
}

try
{
    // Code that may throw custom exceptions
}
catch (CustomException ex)
{
    // Handle custom exceptions
}
```

The custom exception pattern involves creating custom exception classes to represent specific error conditions in your application. By defining custom exceptions, you can provide more meaningful error messages and differentiate between different types of exceptions, making it easier to handle them appropriately.

---

**Chapter 3: Exception Handling Anti-patterns**

In this chapter, we'll discuss common anti-patternsâ€”mistakes and pitfalls to avoidâ€”when handling exceptions in C#. Understanding these anti-patterns will help you write more robust and maintainable code by avoiding common pitfalls.

**3.1 Swallowing Exceptions Anti-pattern**

```csharp
try
{
    // Code that may throw exceptions
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    // Swallow the exception (do nothing)
}
```

The swallowing exceptions anti-pattern involves catching exceptions but not handling or logging them appropriately. Instead, the exception is simply ignored, which can lead to silent failures and unexpected behavior in the application. Swallowing exceptions makes it challenging to diagnose and debug issues in the code.

**3.2 Catching General Exception Anti-pattern**

```csharp
try
{
    // Code that may throw exceptions
}
catch
{
    // Catch all exceptions without handling them
}
```

The catching general exception anti-pattern involves catching all exceptions indiscriminately without specifying the type of exceptions to catch. This makes it difficult to differentiate between different types of exceptions and handle them appropriately. Catching general exceptions can also hide unexpected errors and make debugging more challenging.

**3.3 Overly Broad Catch Blocks Anti-pattern**

```csharp
try
{
    // Code that may throw exceptions
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    // Handle all exceptions in a single catch block
}
```

The overly broad catch blocks anti-pattern involves using catch blocks that are too broad and catch more exceptions than necessary. This can lead to overly generic error handling logic that may not be appropriate for specific types of exceptions. Overly broad catch blocks can also make it harder to diagnose and debug issues in the code.

---

In this chapter, we've explored exception handling patterns and anti-patterns in C#, along with examples of each. By understanding these patterns and anti-patterns, you can improve the robustness and maintainability of your code by implementing effective exception handling practices and avoiding common pitfalls.

**Chapter 1: Introduction to Advanced Exception Handling**

Exception handling is a critical aspect of writing robust and reliable software applications. In this chapter, we'll delve into advanced exception handling techniques in C#, going beyond the basics to explore more sophisticated approaches for handling and managing exceptions effectively.

**1.1 Understanding the Importance of Advanced Exception Handling**

While basic exception handling techniques such as try-catch blocks provide essential error handling capabilities, advanced exception handling techniques offer additional features and strategies to improve code maintainability, performance, and resilience. By mastering advanced exception handling techniques, developers can build more robust and fault-tolerant applications.

**1.2 Overview of Advanced Exception Handling Techniques**

In this section, we'll provide an overview of the advanced exception handling techniques covered in this chapter, including custom exception classes, exception filters, asynchronous exception handling, and exception policies.

---

**Chapter 2: Custom Exception Classes**

One of the key principles of effective exception handling is to use meaningful and descriptive exception types to convey information about the nature of the error. In this chapter, we'll explore how to create custom exception classes in C# to represent specific error conditions and provide additional context for handling exceptions.

**2.1 Creating Custom Exception Classes**

```csharp
using System;

public class CustomException : Exception
{
    public CustomException(string message) : base(message)
    {
    }

    public CustomException(string message, Exception innerException) : base(message, innerException)
    {
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        try
        {
            throw new CustomException("Custom exception occurred.");
        }
        catch (CustomException ex)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Custom exception caught: " + ex.Message);
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, we define a custom exception class `CustomException` that inherits from the `Exception` class. We provide constructors to initialize the exception message and handle inner exceptions. Then, we throw and catch an instance of the custom exception, demonstrating how to use custom exception classes in C#.

---

**Chapter 3: Exception Filters**

Exception filters allow developers to specify conditions under which a catch block should handle an exception. This enables more granular control over exception handling logic and allows for different handling strategies based on specific conditions. Let's explore how to use exception filters in C#.

**3.1 Using Exception Filters**

```csharp
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        try
        {
            throw new ArgumentException("Invalid argument");
        }
        catch (ArgumentException ex) when (ex.ParamName == "someParameter")
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Exception caught with specific parameter name: " + ex.Message);
        }
        catch (ArgumentException ex)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Generic ArgumentException caught: " + ex.Message);
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, we use an exception filter to catch `ArgumentException` instances only when the `ParamName` property matches a specific parameter name. This allows us to handle exceptions differently based on the condition specified in the filter.
