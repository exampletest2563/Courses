# Speed Calculator

## Problem Description

Write a program that calculates the speed of an object based on the distance traveled and the time taken.

## Input

The input consists of two numbers:
- `distance` - representing the distance traveled in kilometers;
- `time` - representing the time taken in hours.

## Output

The output consists of a single value - a positive real number, rounded to two decimal places, representing the speed of the object in kilometers per hour.

## Constraints

Your solution must comply with the following constraints:

- `distance` > 0;
- `time` > 0.

## Examples

|Input|Output|
|-|-|
|120<br />1|120.00 km/h|
|150.5<br />2.5|60.20 km/h|
