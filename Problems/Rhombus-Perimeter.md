# Rhombus Perimeter
## Problem Description
Given the side length of a rhombus, calculate its perimeter. A rhombus is a quadrilateral with all sides of equal length.

The perimeter of a rhombus can be calculated using the formula:
\[ P = 4 \times \text{side length} \]

## Input
The input will contain a single line representing the side length of the rhombus as a positive integer.

## Output
The output will contain a single line representing the perimeter of the rhombus.

## Constraints
- \(1 \leq \text{side length} \leq 10^6\)

## Examples
| Input | Output |
|-------|--------|
| 5     | 20     |
| 10    | 40     |
| 3     | 12     |
