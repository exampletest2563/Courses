# 3 Numbers - Product Sign without Calculation

## Problem Description
Given three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\), determine the sign of their product without actually calculating the product.

## Input
The input will contain three integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\), separated by spaces.

## Output
The output will contain a single line indicating the sign of the product:
- If the product is positive, output "Positive".
- If the product is negative, output "Negative".
- If the product is zero, output "Zero".

## Constraints
- The absolute value of each integer is at most \(10^9\).

## Examples
|Input|Output|
|-|-|
|1 2 3|Positive|
|-1 -2 3|Negative|
|0 0 0|Zero|
