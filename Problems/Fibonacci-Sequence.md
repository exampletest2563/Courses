# Fibonacci Sequence
## Problem Description
The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. The sequence goes as follows: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and so on.

Write a program to calculate the nth Fibonacci number.

## Input
The input will contain a single integer, n (0 <= n <= 50), representing the position of the Fibonacci number to be calculated.

## Output
The output will contain a single integer, representing the nth Fibonacci number.

## Constraints
- 0 <= n <= 50

## Examples
