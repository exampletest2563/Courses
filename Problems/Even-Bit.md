# Even Bit

## Problem Description
Given an integer, your task is to determine if the binary representation of the integer contains an even number of 1 bits.

## Input
The input will contain a single integer.

## Output
The output will contain a single line with "YES" if the binary representation of the integer contains an even number of 1 bits, and "NO" otherwise.

## Constraints
- The input integer will be in the range [0, $10^9$].

## Examples
| Input | Output |
|-------|--------|
| 5     | YES    |
