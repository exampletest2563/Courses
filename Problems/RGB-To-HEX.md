# RGB To HEX Converter
## Problem Description
You are tasked with writing a program to convert RGB (Red, Green, Blue) color values to their corresponding hexadecimal representation. In RGB color model, each color is represented by an intensity value ranging from 0 to 255.

The hexadecimal color representation consists of a '#' symbol followed by two-digit hexadecimal values representing the intensity of red, green, and blue components respectively.

For example, the RGB color (255, 0, 128) would be represented as "#FF0080" in hexadecimal.

## Input
The input will contain three integers separated by spaces, representing the intensity values of red, green, and blue components respectively.

## Output
The output will contain a single line - the hexadecimal representation of the input RGB color.

## Constraints
- The intensity values for red, green, and blue components will be integers in the range [0, 255].

## Examples
|Input|Output|
|-|-|
|255 0 128|#FF0080|
|0 128 255|#0080FF|
|128 128 128|#808080|
