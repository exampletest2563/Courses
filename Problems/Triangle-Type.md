# Triangle Type
## Description
Write a program that takes the lengths of three sides of a triangle and determines whether it is **Equilateral**, **Isosceles**, or **Scalene**.
## Input
The input consists of a three numbers - **a**, **b** & **c**.
## Output
The output consists of a single value.
## Examples
|Input|Output|
|-|-|
|3<br />3<br />3|Equilateral|
|4<br />4<br />2|Isosceles|
|3<br />4<br />5|Scalene|

# Triangle Type
## Problem Description
Given three integers representing the lengths of the sides of a triangle, determine the type of triangle formed: equilateral, isosceles, or scalene.

An equilateral triangle has all sides of equal length, an isosceles triangle has two sides of equal length, and a scalene triangle has all sides of different lengths.

## Input
The input will contain three integers separated by spaces, representing the lengths of the sides of the triangle.

## Output
The output will contain a single line indicating the type of triangle formed: "Equilateral", "Isosceles", or "Scalene".

## Constraints
- The input integers will be positive and less than or equal to 1000.
- The input integers will form a valid triangle.

## Examples
|Input|Output|
|-|-|
|3 3 3|Equilateral|
|5 5 6|Isosceles|
|7 8 10|Scalene|
